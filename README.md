**Introduction**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.

Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

**Key Questions and Objectives**

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their future company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most revenue?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

● What future sales strategies should be recommended?
